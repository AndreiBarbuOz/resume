Computer scientist, RPA Developer, Software engineer, Cloud practitioner

Interested in good practices, correlations between project organization and long term success, understanding the differentiators which make a project work over vast expanses of time and multiple iterations.

## Projects and interests

### RPA demo scalability

A project comprised of multiple repos, with the aim of providing a demo-ready virtual machine containing all the necessary software for showcasing UiPath technology interacting with target applications. The project made use of [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) for the creation of the actual managed image, and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) for the configuration management and application deployment. 

The first cloud implementation was on [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) and it was comprised of 3 repos:
- the [deployment container](https://github.com/AndreiBarbuOz/uipath-demo-image-deploy), consisting of an [Azure pipeline](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/devops/pipelines/) to build the Docker container used in the actual image build
- the [Azure managed image](https://github.com/AndreiBarbuOz/uipath-demo-image) pipeline, building the actual Azure managed image, which is the base for all demo VM's. It is a build pipeline, which takes the configuration as code
- the [demo environment](https://github.com/AndreiBarbuOz/uipath-demo-environment)


### Testing automation demo environment

### UiPath Orchestrator python client library

### DevOps in RPA


### RPA good practices

A list of practices which should followed when developing RPA projects. The project is ongoing and can be found [here](https://github.com/AndreiBarbuOz/uipath-good-practices). Forks and PRs are welcomed.
